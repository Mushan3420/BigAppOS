/**
 ICSDrawerController is a left-side drawer controller for iPhone (iOS 7 or later).
 
 It has all the features you'd expect from a side drawer controller, plus it's small, easy to read and tailor to your needs.
 
 The controller is designed as a container controller and accepts two child controllers: the left and the center view controllers. The left view controller is intended as a master view controller: it is visible only when the drawer is open and, typically, talks to the drawer in order to update/replace the center view controller. The center view controller is intended as a detail view controller: it is visible when the drawer is closed and typically sends the `open` message to the drawer to reveal the left side controller.
 
 ## Opening/closing the drawer
 ICSDrawerController uses a UIPanGestureRecognizer to open/close the drawer and a UITapGestureRecognizer to close the drawer by tapping anywhere on the visible part of the center view controller.
 
 It is left to your center view controller to provide a button and call `open` on the drawer controller. (From your child controllers you access the drawer controller by adopting the `ICSDrawerControllerChild` protocol and implementing the required `drawer` property.)
 
 ## Status bar
 You can control the status bar's visibility and style by implementing, in each one of your child controllers, the `prefersStatusBarHidden`  and `preferredStatusBarStyle` methods made available by iOS 7.
 
 ## Getting notified when the drawer state changes
 The drawer controller will notify its child controllers by sending:
 
 - the message `drawerControllerWillOpen:` when the drawer is about to open
 - the message `drawerControllerDidOpen:` when the drawer has completed the opening phase
 - the message `drawerControllerWillClose:` when the drawer is about to close
 - the message `drawerControllerDidClose:` when the drawer has completed the closing phase
 
 ## Installing
 1. Drag the inner ICSDrawerController folder to your Xcode project
 2. Adopt in your child controllers the `ICSDrawerControllerChild` protocol and implement its the required `drawer` property
 3. Adopt in your child controllers the `ICSDrawerControllerPresenting` protocol
 4. Initialize the drawer controller with your left view controller and your initial center view controller:
 
    YourLeftViewController *left = [[YourLeftViewController alloc] init];
    YourCenterViewController *center = [[YourCenterViewController alloc] init];
    ICSDrawerController *drawer = [[ICSDrawerController alloc] initWithLeftViewController:left
                                                                     centerViewController:center];
